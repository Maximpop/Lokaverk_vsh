					<p>This is a man driven by an unbridled and relentless passion for music. Armin van Buuren is a born perfectionist, striving to stay on top of the scene he’s helped build. The flag-bearer of the trance movement, he’s one of the most influential figures in EDM worldwide. Even though he lives an extraordinary life as one of the world’s most popular DJs, he has always remained a down-to-earth guy. Armin van Buuren is constantly on the move, either with the music he creates in his studio or en route to his next high-end club or festival show around the globe.<br><br>
					Armin: “It’s not just love for music, it’s my passion. It goes beyond liking, and beyond a hobby. It’s about a way of living. Music is essential to my life.”</p>

					<h4>The Dj</h4>
					<p>No matter how many hours Armin van Buuren has travelled to get there, as soon as he enters the DJ booth, the Dutchman puts his full focus on the music, the crowd, and how those two will combine. As soon as the beats of his first record have kicked in, the room lights up and chanting starts to fill the air. To witness a set of Armin van Buuren is to be blown away — to completely lose yourself into the music and be one with the people around you. Mixed seamlessly, he created his own sound and style, making his DJ sets a unique experience. He unites millions, not only through the gigs in his challenging schedule, but also through his ‘Armin Only’ and ‘A State of Trance’ world tours.</p>
