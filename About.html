					<p>Armin van Buuren was born in Leiden, Netherlands, on 25 December 1976, but grew up in Koudekerk aan den Rijn. Van Buuren started making music when he was 14. He was inspired by French electronic music composer Jean Michel Jarre. He graduated from the Stedelijk Gymnasium Leiden in 1995, and studied law at Leiden University. He began working as a DJ in Club Next, playing multiple sets a week, most of which lasted six or more hours. As his musical career began to take off he put his law degree on hold, although he returned to graduate from law school in 2003. On 18 September 2009, Van Buuren married Erika van Thiel, with whom he had been together for nine years. Their daughter Fenna was born in July 2011. Van Buuren announced just hours before he was due to headline the main stage at Tomorrowland (Saturday, 27 July 2013) that his wife had given birth to a son, Remy. In 2011, Van Buuren was appointed Officer of the Order of Orange Nassau for his services to music.</p>
